# Installation

Follow these instructions to install ecAudit in each node of your Cassandra cluster.
This will enable all the features provided by ecAudit.
Visit the [sertup guide](setup.md) for a detailed list of options.


## Deploy Plug-In Jar File

Place the ecAudit jar file in your ```$CASSANDRA_HOME/lib/``` directory.
Get the official releases from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22com.ericsson.bss.cassandra.ecaudit%22%20AND%20a:%22ecaudit_c4.0%22).


## Enable Plug-In

The ecAudit plug-in is enabled by configuring a few different plug-in settings in Cassandra.


### cassandra.yaml

Change the following settings in your ```cassandra.yaml```.

```
authenticator: com.ericsson.bss.cassandra.ecaudit.auth.AuditAuthenticator
authorizer: com.ericsson.bss.cassandra.ecaudit.auth.AuditAuthorizer
role_manager: com.ericsson.bss.cassandra.ecaudit.auth.AuditRoleManager
```

By default the AuditAuthenticator, AuditAuthorizer and AuditRoleManager delegates operations to the standard PasswordAuthenticator, CassandraAuthorizer and CassandraRoleManager respectively.
All configuration options and recommendations for the standard plug-ins applies for the Audit plug-ins as well.
For instance, remember to increase the replication factor of the ```system_auth``` keyspace.
Consult the Cassandra [configuration documentation](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/configuration/index.html) for details.


### cassandra-env.sh

Add the following JVM option to your ```cassandra-env.sh``` or your ```cassandra.in.sh```.

**Note:** If you configure these settings in your ```cassandra-env.sh```,
consider that the ```JVM_EXTRA_OPTS``` variable is consumed at the end of the file,
so make sure to add the following lines *before* they are consumed.

```
JVM_EXTRA_OPTS="$JVM_EXTRA_OPTS -Dcassandra.custom_query_handler_class=com.ericsson.bss.cassandra.ecaudit.handler.AuditQueryHandler"
JVM_EXTRA_OPTS="$JVM_EXTRA_OPTS -da:net.openhft..."
```

The first line installs the ecAudit QueryHandler plug-in.
The second line disable asserts for the Chronicle logger backend.
